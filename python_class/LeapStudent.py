# The following statement will take in a year and will put it in the variable N
N = int(input("Please enter a year > 399: ").strip())
#################
# Step1
#################
# create 2 variables one for the string 'Leap Year!' - the other for 'Common Year'

#################
# Step2
#################
# Commonly we think of a leap year as divisible by 4
# Check to see if the year is divisible by 4 and print the appropriate variable if it is  orisnt
# Use the if / elif / else you learned last time
# the mathematical symbol to see that the remainder is in a division operation is '%'
# the following is an example to check if a variable 'somenum' has a remainer of 0 when divided by 5
#if (somenum % 5 == 0):

#################
# Step3
#################
# So we can check if the year is divisible evenly by 4 ...
# but this is not *exactly* correct. Lets look at Wikipedia
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm
# How can we turn this into a correct algorithm?
#
# wikipedia shows us:
# if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
# else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
# else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
# else (it is a leap year)

# EXTRA1  redo the above with one print statement (hint use a new var to hold Year)
