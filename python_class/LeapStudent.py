# The following statement will take in a year and will put it in the variable N
N = int(input("Please enter a year > 399: ").strip())
#################
# Step1
#################
# create 2 variables one for the string 'Leap Year!' - the other for 'Common Year'
# do your work here:


#################
# Step2
#################
# Commonly we think of a leap year as divisible by 4
# the following is an example to check if a variable 'x' has a remainer of 0 when divided by 4
#if x % 4 == 0:
#   print("divisible by 4")


#################
# Step3
#################
# wikipedia shows us algorithm for leap year:
# if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
# else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
# else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
# else (it is a leap year)
#


#################
# EXTRA1  redo the above with one print statement (hint use a new var to hold Year)

#################
# EXTRA2  redo the above with Boolean variables
