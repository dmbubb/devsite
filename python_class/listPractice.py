# lists
#in Python, 'lists' are ordered collections of elements
#
#we have seen lists of numbers:
#list_num = [2, 4, 6, 8]
#
#we have seen lists of strings
#list_name = ["Selma", "Diane", "George", "EunJung"]
#
#Because a list is 'ordered' it has an index (remember this starts from 0)
#what would this print?
colorlst = ["red", "blue", "orange", "green"]
#print(colorlst[2])
#
# There is a method to add something to a list - "append()"
# try the following
#print(colorlst)
#colorlst.append("grey")
#print(colorlst)
#
# Do math with lists
#test_grades = [ 87, 75, 92, 79, 94, 89 ]
# How many tests were there?
# number_of_tests = len(test_grades)
#
# How can you get the average of the tests?
#for i in range(number_of_tests):
#  ???
