Aunt Carol is not technically a relative but my mother's childhood friend and my brother's godmother. In her 70's she is intelligent and clear eyed with an Irish-Norwegian tallness and bearing. I've spent time around Jesuits, Benedictines and Franciscians and she has that Catholic intellectual way of parsing problems and telling stories.

Carol has always been very independent. She took care of her brother who had a life long illness. He was equally Jesuitical having studied under the SJ for high school, college and lawschool. St Peters (high school) to Fordham. Carol went to Seton Hill out in Pennsylvania then back to St Peters (college) for advanced degrees in Psychology.
